            In 2023, a project was started to relaunch BME's websites and update its branding. The design process involved UX researchers, 
            UI designers, and web developers. The university also invited students to participate, and after an interview, 
            I was fortunate to join the UI design team.<br>
            As part of the team, I was responsible for designing individual pages and UI elements in Figma. My tasks included creating wireframes,
            clickable prototypes, and graphics, as well as designing the layout and content of the pages.

                        through interviews and collaborative work.

        <h2>Design process</h2>
        <p>
            At the beginning of the design process, we familiarized ourselves with the existing Figma library, the intended styles, and the main brand elements. 
            Our goal was to create a cleaner, more youthful website that would be easy to navigate for all members of the target audience.<br>

            The library included colors, font styles, spacing rules (gaps, padding, and margins) for both desktop and mobile views. 
            Based on this, we first created reusable components and their variants (such as buttons, cards, headers, and footers) to be used consistently across the site.

        <h2>Results from the website</h2>
        <p>
            Below are selected screenshots from the redesigned university website. These illustrate the final UI layouts, component use, 
            and responsive behavior. The designs were created in Figma and follow the updated brand guidelines, 
            focusing on clarity, accessibility, and a consistent user experience across devices.
