            In 2022, I was introduced to the basics of UI and UX design within the framework of software ergonomics.
            Together with a group mate, we chose a research project announced by the Hungarian National Bank for our
            course project,
            and later presented it at the Scientific Students' Associations Conference (TDK), where we achieved second
            place in our section,
            and at the National Association for Student Research (OTDK), where we were awarded first place.
            The aim of our research was to compare and analyze current mobile banking applications using a combination
            of qualitative and quantitative methods.
            We combined analytical and empirical approaches to assess the user experience.
            A usability study was conducted with the support of Tobii Nano eye-tracking technology,
            and participants also completed a System Usability Scale (SUS) assessment. These findings were further
            enriched through a series of expert interviews with
            professionals from the financial technology (FinTech) sector, along with a large-scale user questionnaire.
            Based on the insights gathered, we formulated development recommendations for both the user interface and
            core functionalities
            of an ideal mobile banking application, and created a clickable prototype to demonstrate its key features.

                    <p>This was a TDK project completed with another student, under the guidance of a supervisor,
                        focusing on user-centered research and design.

                    <h2>Impact</h2>
                    <p>Our findings led to the design of a prototype banking app with a clean, intuitive interface,
                        featuring quick balance check and easy transfers.
                        The thesis received second place in its TDK section and first place at the OTDK.

                        The study was later presented as a TDK project.

        <h2>Research process</h2>
        <p>
            The aim of our research was to explore user opinions on the mobile applications of domestic banks and to
            design an ideal
            user interface based on these insights. We began by outlining the research framework and selecting
            appropriate methodologies.
            The chosen methods included: an eye-tracking usability study, the System Usability Scale (SUS), follow-up
            user interviews,
            a series of expert interviews, and a large-sample questionnaire.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the usability study, we employed Tobii Nano eye-tracking technology to evaluate the mobile
            applications of seven different banks.
            Each of the seven participants tested five applications, resulting in a total of 35 individual tests.
            Participants were instructed to verbalize their thoughts while completing specific tasks (think-aloud
            protocol).
            The collected data was visualized through heatmaps and gaze plots, allowing us to analyze attention
            distribution and navigation patterns.

        <p>
            Following the usability tests, participants completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire to
            evaluate the perceived usability
            of each application. The SUS consisted of 10 standardized items rated on a 5-point Likert scale.
            Results indicated that OTP Bank and Gránit Bank received the highest usability scores. Applications were
            rated more favorably
            when they featured a visually appealing design, clear categorization, intuitive navigation, and well-labeled
            icons.
            Conversely, lower scores were associated with cluttered layouts, slow loading times,
            poor navigation structures, and unnecessary procedural steps.

            We conducted in-depth interviews with five industry experts. The interviews explored current development
            trends, common pitfalls in banking app design,
            the characteristics of an ideal banking application, and future directions for digital banking. Key findings
            highlighted the importance
            of streamlining basic operations — such as initiating transfers, checking balances, and reviewing transaction
            history.
            Additional priorities included technological reliability, personalization, a diverse range of digital
            services, and ensuring accessibility for all users.

            Our online questionnaire was completed by over 260 respondents. The questionnaire began with demographic
            data collection, followed by
            questions addressing general banking habits, financial literacy, and preferred platforms for conducting
            banking activities.
            Participants also provided feedback on their current mobile banking experiences and their views on neobanks.
            Key findings highlighted the importance of simplicity, ease of access, transparency, and convenience.
            There was also a clear demand for features such as spending categorization, graphical visualizations,
            integration of all banking functionalities, international transfers, detailed account history, and
            the ability to purchase securities and government bonds directly through domestic banking apps.
        </p>

        <h2>Results and prototyping</h2>
        <p>
            At the conclusion of the research, we translated our findings into a conceptual design by developing several
            key screens
            of an ideal banking application and creating a clickable prototype. The most frequently used functions were
            prioritized
            and placed on the home screen, alongside a spending chart to enhance financial transparency.
            <br>
            To support financial literacy, we introduced a financial assistant concept,
            designed to help users better understand and manage their personal finances.
            Based on our insights, we recommended that banks reassess their IT infrastructure and
            optimize their banking processes with a user-centered approach, focusing on accessibility, clarity, and
            seamless user experience.
